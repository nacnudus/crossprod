# Biography

My name is Duncan Garmonsway. I began doing data things in the New Zealand
government, then worked for a big-six energy company in Glasgow, and now create
[registers](https://registers.cloudapps.digital/) for the UK Government Digital
Service, part of the Cabinet Office.  I write about R, data, and overcoming
technical frustrations to meet analytical needs.

Try my R packages:

* [tidyxl](https://nacnudus.github.io/tidyxl/) imports non-tabular Excel files,
    including formatting.
* [unpivotr](https://nacnudus.github.io/unpivotr/) tidies complex tables by
    understanding relative positions.
* [nzpullover](https://nacnudus.github.io/nzpullover/) is an up-to-date dataset
    of New Zealand road offences
